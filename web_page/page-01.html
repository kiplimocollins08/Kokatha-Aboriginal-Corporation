We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.

When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.

When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information.</p>

<p>The Kokatha People decided to form this Aboriginal Corporation to be the prescribed body corporate and to become the registered native title body corporate for the determined areas pursuant to section 57(2) of the NTA and to manage the native title rights and interests of the Common Law Holders. 

On 29 October 2021 Kokatha Aboriginal Corporation was appointed as the Recognised Aboriginal Representative Body (RARB) for its native title determination area under Part 2B of the Aboriginal Heritage Act 1988 (SA).  </p>
